# MyContract

## Overview

MyContract is a simple smart contract demonstrating the use of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements in Solidity. It allows the owner to set, decrement, and reset a value with proper validation and error handling.

## Description

This smart contract is written in Solidity and is designed to showcase the use of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements. The contract has functions that demonstrate how to use these statements for input validation and error handling. This project serves as a useful introduction to more complex Solidity programming.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you will need:
- A computer with internet access
- A web browser
- Access to Remix, an online Solidity IDE

### Executing the Program

1. **Go to Remix**
   Open your web browser and navigate to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. **Create a New File**
   In the left-hand sidebar, click on the "+" icon to create a new file. Save the file with a `.sol` extension (e.g., `MyContract.sol`).

3. **Copy and Paste the Code**
   Copy and paste code from the MyContract.sol into your new file:

4. **Compile the Code**
   Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Ensure the "Compiler" option is set to `0.8.0` (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyContract.sol" button.

5. **Deploy the Contract**
   Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the `MyContract` contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

6. **Interact with the Contract**
   Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling its functions. Click on the `MyContract` contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then call the `setValue`, `decrementValue`, and `resetValue` functions as needed.
